# EvreteRuleEngine
It is spring boot project.
In which you take a number in request body and find it is even odd or prime by using evrete rule engine.
Here I write 4 rules:-
1) Number is even
2) Number is odd
3) Number is prime
4) Number is non- prime

You can save rule file with anyname and any extension.
